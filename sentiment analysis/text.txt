Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence
and community values in the mere accumulation of material things.
Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year,
but that Gross National Product - if we judge the United States of America
by that - that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette
advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. 
It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them.
It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder
in chaotic sprawl.  It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored
cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities.  It counts Whitman's
rifle and Speck's knife, and the television programs which glorify violence
in order to sell toys to our children.  Yet the gross national product
does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their
education or the joy of their play.  It does not include the beauty 
of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our 
public debate or the integrity of our public officials.  It measures neither 
our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our 
compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, 
except that which makes life worthwhile.  And it can tell us everything about 
America except why we are proud that we are Americans.
